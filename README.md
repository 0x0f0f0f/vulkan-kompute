## Getting Started

### Setup

Kompute is provided as a single header file [`Kompute.hpp`](#setup) that can be simply included in your code and integrated with the shared library.

This project is built using cmake, providing a simple way to integrate as static or shared library across multiple platforms including mobile, game engines and various other platforms - see [build-system section](#build-overview) for more details.


#### Your First Kompute

Pass compute shader data in glsl/hlsl text or compiled SPIR-V format (or as path to the file). View [more examples](https://kompute.cc/overview/advanced-examples.html#simple-examples).

```c++
int main() {

    // You can allow Kompute to create the Vulkan components, or pass your existing ones
    kp::Manager mgr; // Selects device 0 unless explicitly requested

    // Creates tensor an initializes GPU memory (below we show more granularity)
    auto tensorA = std::make_shared<kp::Tensor>(kp::Tensor({ 3., 4., 5. }));
    auto tensorB = std::make_shared<kp::Tensor>(kp::Tensor({ 0., 0., 0. }));

    // Create tensors data explicitly in GPU with an operation
    mgr.evalOpDefault<kp::OpTensorCreate>({ tensorA, tensorB });

    // Define your shader as a string (using string literals for simplicity)
    // (You can also pass the raw compiled bytes, or even path to file)
    std::string shader(R"(
        #version 450

        layout (local_size_x = 1) in;

        layout(set = 0, binding = 0) buffer a { float pa[]; };
        layout(set = 0, binding = 1) buffer b { float pb[]; };

        void main() {
            uint index = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
            pb[index] = pa[index];
            pa[index] = index;
        }
    )");

    // Run Kompute operation on the parameters provided with dispatch layout
    mgr.evalOpDefault<kp::OpAlgoBase<3, 1, 1>>(
        { tensorA, tensorB }, 
        std::vector<char>(shader.begin(), shader.end()));

    // Sync the GPU memory back to the local tensor
    mgr.evalOpDefault<kp::OpTensorSyncLocal>({ tensorA, tensorB });

    // Prints the output which is A: { 0, 1, 2 } B: { 3, 4, 5 }
    std::cout << fmt::format("A: {}, B: {}", 
        tensorA.data(), tensorB.data()) << std::endl;
}
```

## Components & Architecture

The core architecture of Kompute include the following:
* Kompute Manager - Base orchestrator which creates and manages device and child components
* Kompute Sequence - Container of operations that can be sent to GPU as batch
* Kompute Operation - Individual operation which performs actions on top of tensors and (opt) algorithms
* Kompute Tensor - Tensor structured data used in GPU operations
* Kompute Algorithm - Abstraction for (shader) code executed in the GPU
* Kompute ParameterGroup - Container that can group tensors to be fed into an algorithm

To see a full breakdown you can read further in the documentation.

## Asynchronous and Parallel Operations

Kompute provides flexibility to run operations in an asynrchonous way through Vulkan Fences. Furthermore, Kompute enables for explicit allocation of queues, which allow for parallel execution of operations across queue families.

The image below provides an intuition how Kompute Sequences can be allocated to different queues for to enable parallel execution based on hardware. This allows for workloads to be run in parallel across the graphics and compute queue families. 

You can see the [hands on example](https://kompute.cc/overview/advanced-examples.html#parallel-operations), as well as the [detailed documentation page](https://kompute.cc/overview/async-parallel.html) describing how it would work using an NVIDIA 1650 as example.

## Motivations

This project started after seeing that a lot of new and renowned ML & DL projects like Pytorch, Tensorflow, Alibaba DNN, between others, have either integrated or are looking to integrate the Vulkan GPU SDK to add mobile GPU (and cross-vendor GPU) support.

The Vulkan SDK offers a great low level interface that enables for highly specialized optimizations - however it comes at a cost of highly verbose code which requires 500-2000 lines of code to even begin writing application code. This has resulted in each of these projects having to implement the same baseline to abstract the non-compute related features of Vulkan, although it's not always the case, this can result in slower development cycles, and opportunities for bugs to be introduced.

We are currently developing Vulkan Kompute not to hide the Vulkan SDK interface (as it's incredibly well designed) but to augment it with a direct focus on Vulkan's GPU computing capabilities. [This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-and-data-processing-in-the-gpu-with-vulkan-kompute-c9350e5e5d3a) provides a high level overview of the motivations of Kompute, together with a set of hands on examples that introduce both GPU computing as well as the core Vulkan Kompute architecture.

## Build Overview

The build system provided is `cmake` which allows for cross platform builds. Below is a brief overview of the build system.

### Build parameters (cmake)

The recommended approach to build the project is as out-of-source build in the `build` folder. This project comes with a `Makefile` that provides a set of commands that help with developer workflows. You can see some of the commands if you want to add some of the more advanced commands.

For a base build you just have to run:
```
cmake -Bbuild
```

This by default configures without any of the extra build tasks (such as building shaders) and compiles without the optional dependencies. The table below provides more detail.

### Dependencies

Given Kompute is expected to be used across a broad range of architectures and hardware, it will be important to make sure we are able to minimise dependencies. 

#### Required dependencies

The only required dependency in the build is Vulkan (vulkan.h and vulkan.hpp which are both part of the Vulkan SDK).

#### Optional dependencies

SPDLOG is the preferred logging library, however by default Vulkan Kompute runs without SPDLOG by overriding the macros. It also provides an easy way to override the macros if you prefer to bring your own logging framework. The macro override is the following:

```c++
#ifndef KOMPUTE_LOG_OVERRIDE // Use this if you want to define custom macro overrides
#if KOMPUTE_SPDLOG_ENABLED // Use this if you want to enable SPDLOG
#include <spdlog/spdlog.h>
#endif //KOMPUTE_SPDLOG_ENABLED
// ... Otherwise it adds macros that use std::cout (and only print first element)
#endif // KOMPUTE_LOG_OVERRIDE
```

You can choose to build with or without SPDLOG by using the cmake flag `KOMPUTE_OPT_ENABLE_SPDLOG`.

Finally, remember that you will still need to set both the compile time log level with `SPDLOG_ACTIVE_LEVEL`, and the runtime log level with `spdlog::set_level(spdlog::level::debug);`.
